Analysis Output:
Looking at the Nsight Systems data for "Session 1", the following details emerge:

1. Total Duration: The total duration of the session is 120.5 seconds. During this time, there are three events taking place which seem to be using significant amounts of system resources.

2. CPU Usage: The overall CPU usage is at 75.2%, with event_3 pushing the CPU usage to a high of 90.1%. High CPU utilization may indicate that your application or system processes are using a lot of CPU, slowing down other tasks and potentially causing the system to run hot, which may lead to other issues.

3. GPU Usage: The GPU usage for the session averaged 88.3%. In particular, event_3 utilized around 95.3% of the GPU's capacity, which points towards a considerable reliance on GPU. This high GPU usage indicates that the program is GPU-bound. This could possibly inhibit performance as other GPU tasks might queue up, leading to increased latency.

4. Memory Usage and Disk IO: The session's memory utilization is on the lower side at 62.5%, and the disk IO is only 15.2. This implies memory and disk usage aren't likely to be causing any bottlenecks in the current scenario.

5. Network IO: The network usage is at a minimal 5.7, indicating that network IO is not a problematic factor here.

From the given data, evident areas for potential bottlenecks are CPU and GPU utilization. These high utilization rates, especially during events, suggest that the computational tasks are quite intensive.

Optimization Strategies:

1. Event Processing: Look into optimizing how event_2 and event_3 are processed. These events cause very high CPU and GPU usage and might benefit from the process revision or alternative solutions.

2. GPU Optimization: The high GPU usage might restrict other tasks from being executed on the GPU. Consider using techniques like asynchronous execution, stream multiplexing, or extensively optimizing your GPU algorithms.

3. CPU Utilization: If the CPU-intensive tasks cannot be split or simplified, consider parallelizing some of these tasks to distribute to available CPU cores more effectively.

4. Memory and Disk IO: Though these do not appear to be performance bottlenecks currently, be aware that future enhancements in processor performance (CPU & GPU) may be held back if the memory and disk usage increase or their efficiency reduces.

Investigate the parts of the program corresponding to event_2 and event_3 for code optimization or potential benefits of hardware upgrades that support higher CPU and GPU speed. Look at GPU profiling tools, for example, to get more granular data on what's going on at the moment when GPU usage spikes.
