Identify areas that should be inspected further for bottlenecks. Suggest areas taking up the most resources and provide general optimization advice.

Analysis Output:
Looking at the provided Nsight Systems data, here are the areas that exhibit potential performance bottlenecks and high resource usage:

1. **MatrixMultiplication**: This function is consuming a significant amount of CPU usage (85%) and memory usage (650 units). 

2. **RenderScene**: Even though the actual CPU and memory usage for this function isn't as high as others, the GPU idle time is significantly high (55%). This suggests that the function is either not using the GPU effectively or it might be bottlenecked by other resources.

3. **DeepLearningTraining**: This function stands out with the highest CPU usage (90%) and memory usage (950 units), but it also has the highest GPU idle time (60%). 

Areas for Further Inspection:
- **MatrixMultiplication & DeepLearningTraining**: the high CPU and memory usage shows a potential issue. You might be able to optimize this usage through more efficient algorithms or data structures.
- **DeepLearningTraining**: High GPU idle time means your deep learning algorithm isn't fully utilizing the available GPU, the algorithm might benefit from optimization for better GPU utilization or it's possible the process is being bottlenecked by the need to wait on data preparation stages or other shared resource limitations.
- **RenderScene**: Examine why the GPU idle time is significant. If the process isn’t GPU-bound, try to reduce the dependency on other resources.

General Optimization Advice:
- Try to parallelize operations where possible.
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms.
- When using large data, ensure cache friendliness.
- Defer operations that aren't immediately necessary.
- Analyze the possibility to use lower-precision data types in deep learning training since they use less memory and enable the GPU to process a larger batch of data at a time.
- Revisit the memory allocation strategy, making sure to reuse memory where possible rather than constantly allocating and deallocating, which is a performance-intensive operation.
- Load balancing between CPU and GPU can also bring about noticeable performance improvements.
